# diabetics_prediction
This repository contains a project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using various machine-learning algorithms. The goal is to build and evaluate models that can assist early diagnosis by analyzing key medical factors.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization and analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships.
- Modeling: Implement multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks.
- Model Evaluation: Comparison of models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model performance using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
- Deployment: Basic deployment script using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.

## Dataset
The project uses the Diabetes dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes features such as:

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
- Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that represents genetic inheritance
- Age: Age (years)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train and evaluate models.
4. Optionally, deploy the model using the provided deployment script.
